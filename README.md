**What is QUIZZING?**

Quizzing is an educational application designed for students to facilitate their learning.
Quizzing provides two options to the users: 1) make a quiz 2) take the quiz. 
When the user chooses option one, a new quiz will be made and be stored in the quiz library. 
Then the user can write a series of multiple-choice questions along with the answer keys. 
While making the quiz, the user may choose to either add or remove the quiz. 
If the user chooses option two, they may search for a previously-made quizzes in the quiz library and take a quiz. 
Each time the user answers the question, Quzzing will show te result to the question. 

**Why Quizzing?**

Many students prepare for their exams by making review questions.
As a student who made hundreds to review questions to study for the exam, I find it difficult to keep track of all the quizzes. 
I want an application where I can make, solve, and store quizzes in an organized manner, and quizzing will provide all the desired attributes to boast my GPA!
